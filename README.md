# todo-list-rest-api-spring-boot

REST API that has been created when I started learning Spring Boot, SQL, DBs, Java and all other topics needed for backend development.
As I progress with my learning I will be updating this with additional features.

## How to run the app

In order to run the app you will need the MySQL DB for storing todo list data.
I have provided a file `create_test_db.sql` with script that will allow you to create db and fill it in with some dummy data.

After getting the DB up and running you can simply run the app as any other spring boot apps in your favorite IDE.
